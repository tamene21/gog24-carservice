# Car Sharing Web App

A car sharing web app using React and Tailwind CSS to assist riders in enhancing their income while delivering a service and help passengers to manage their time from their spot with an affordable cost. The primary objective of this project is to serve as a hub for riders and passengers to meetup and together do business in a service.
